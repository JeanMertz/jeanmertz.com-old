# About Me

_I am a senior software engineer focused on the combination of high-level
abstract APIs and low-level performance-driven systems._

As a **backend engineer** I have worked extensively with backend systems, while
also maintaining clients to interact with those systems. I enjoy working with
high-level languages to abstract away business rules behind easy-to-use APIs
and am also getting more interested in lower-level concepts such as memory
management, CPU registers, cache lines, network packets and file descriptors to
develop for resource-constrained environments.

I get **excited by any opportunity to optimize processes** within an
organisation either by automating that which can be automated, by applying UX
improvements to systems that are operated by other humans, or by streamlining
processes such as communication flows, team compositions and removing
unnecessary red tape.

I **thrive in a flat organisation** that values high impact contributions by all
employees. I have a breadth of knowledge with a work ethic that allows me to be
self-regulated and trusted in _doing the right thing_. Conversely, I don’t do
well in constrained single-purpose roles that allow for little experimentation
and have a highly regulated work regime.

I am a **skilled communicator with managerial experience** and a feeling for
user experience which allows me to bridge the gap between different units within
an organisation. I enjoy coaching my peers and get _fuzzy feelings_ when I can
make a small contribution to the growth of others.

I am an **avid learner** of a diverse set of fields, such as software
engineering, communication, management, mathematics, physics and astronomy.
I enjoy learning new programming languages and engineering paradigms, I am a big
proponent of learning by _active reading_ and by expanding that knowledge by
_continued experimentation_.

I am a **huge space nerd** and regret never having spent the time to graduate in
physics & astronomy to allow me to combine my technical skills with my biggest
passion. Never say never, but so far I consider this to be my biggest
professional failure.

And last, but certainly not least, **I am a family man that cares for his
peers**, the environment and surroundings. I take pride in my focus on
solidarity and openness to diversity. I respect all walks of life that respect
others and enjoy being around and working with people that bring
life-perspectives that differ from my own. I try to avoid monoculture
environments, even though unfortunately that is still difficult to do in our
industry.

## Past and Present Roles

_My experiences over the past decade have shaped my understanding of businesses
and the role that software plays in automating, simplifying, and enriching the
world._

As a **Technical Support Agent** I know that software exists to serve the needs
of the customer. What might be obvious to you is not always obvious to others,
and your software should reflect the diverse world we live in, serving both able
and impaired people from all walks of life.

As a **Site Reliability Engineer** I know that _trust_ in your organisation is
the most valuable relationship you can have with your customers. Trust can be
lost in a short timespan, but takes many more cycles to regain. The stability of
the systems your business operates on is of critical importance, and is worth
more than it seems. Prevention trumps cure, so observability must be a big part
of your operation to ensure smooth sailing.

As a **Software Engineer** I’ve learnt to build systems as complex as they need
to be to fullfil their role within a product or organisation, but no more
complex than that. I’ve learned that every line of code is a liability that
adds operational costs to an organisation and must therefor be justified to
exist. Documentation done right is a highly valuable asset to any organisation,
but done wrong can become an unwelcome time sink.

As a **Software Architect** I understand that software does not exist in
a vacuum and must always serve a higher purpose in collaboration with other
systems, both internal and external to the organisation. The whole of these
systems must be in-tune or risk slowing down the speed at which an organisation
can iterate. A ubiquitous language surrounding the domain models used throughout
the organisation is a highly valuable asset that warrants significant
intellectual investments.

As a **Technical Lead** I realise that delivering a successful product is the
result of a combination of short bursts of intense periods of activity spread
out over a longer period of time. Sprints are needed to make sure you meet your
short-term goals while never losing sight of the clarity and planning needed for
a sustainable long-term marathon. Technical debt is part of every organisation,
and must be paid off at a constant pace, to not drag down the speed of
iteration. It must never be allowed to become a reason for not shipping on time.

As an **Engineering Coach** I know that every engineer is a human being with
needs, personality traits, misfortunes and personal goals. The software running
the organisation is only as good as the strength and hapiness of your team.
Engineers are smart, dedicated and always re-educating themselves, provide in
that thirst for knowledge, and you have a formula to sustain your most valuable
assets. Give your best engineers plenty of opportunities to learn from others
outside your organisation, while allocating their time wisely to help them teach
those within your organisation.

As a **Chief Technology Officer** I’ve experienced the importance of the
collaboration between tech, product, marketing, and operations. All of these
departments need to work in tandum for an organisation to succeed. None serves
the other, but all serve the mission and vision of the organisation. A technical
roadmap is of no value on its own, but must strike a balance between achieving
technical excellence, and delivering on planned product features.

As a **Human Being** I know that I want to do good for this world, and want to
leave it in a better state than I found it. I realise that software – similar to
other tools – can be used for good and bad, and I choose to only use it for
good. I am principled in that way, and I do not appologise for that. The mission
statement of an organisation matters a great deal, the way the organisation
lives up to that statement on a day to day basis matters even more.

## Personality Traits

_Some more serious than others, here’s a short-list of what I find interesting
or questionable about myself_

- I can get watery eyes when I see a touching moment
- I have a terrible memory, and need to write everything down
- I enjoy being around cats, but also love dogs and other animals

- I have long had a feeling of impostor syndrome, but that has faded over time
- I struggle with being brief and to-the-point _(it’s okay to laugh now)_
- I strongly dislike advertisements and instead pay for software, content and
  services whenever possible.
- I have a light case of ”[benign essential tremor][]”, it does not impact my life
  in a significant way, other than I will never beat you at a game of [wire
  loop][].

# Employment History

I’ve mostly worked at startup and small-size companies. I’ve worked for one
enterprise-level company in the past, but found out that the working environment
in such a large company does not suit my style and so I plan on working in
smaller sized companies going forward.

## Current Employer: Blendle

**Since January 2015**, I have been a backend-focused software engineer at
[Blendle][], a scale-up-phase startup leading the charge in modernising the
distribution of journalism in the internet age.

As a **Software Engineer** (January 2015 – February 2016) I joined a small team
of engineers that started the company, working on rapid iterations of our
product, building out the software and infrastructure stack required to support
our exponential growth. In this role, I:

- helped the adoption of software methodologies such as
  **agile software development**, **test-driven development** and **pair
  programming**,

- led a greenfield ”[Blendle Button][]” project written in **Ruby** and
  **React**,

- [led the transition][] to a cloud-native **Kubernetes-based infrastructure**
  stack,

- focussed on optimising our communication and **[automating][]** that which could,

- took on the role of **scrum lead** in several projects,

- built an [in-house CI/CD pipeline][] on top of **Jenkins** and **Kubernetes**,

- collaborated on a **high-performance** [Go-based even-driven email delivery system][],

- built and integrated the ”[Blendle Premium][]” subscription service with
  **payment service providers**,

- built a high-performance Go-based **analytics pipeline** [on top of Kafka][].

As the **Chief Technical Officer** (February 2016 – January 2019), I:

- was responsible for the **engineering team** and the software stack,
- collaborated in our [hiring efforts],
- helped our engineers grow by coaching them and helping them in their
  **personal development plans**,
- helped foster a **culture of software engineering and architecture**,
- set out the **technology roadmap** in collaboration with the product roadmap,

As a **Lead Software Engineer** (January 2019 – present), I:

- conducted numerous in-depth multi-hour interviews with candidates to **find the
  right person to replace me** as the [CTO of Blendle][],
- **re-found my passion** and refocussed my efforts on being actively involved
  in software engineering and architecture,
- stayed involved in non-technical duties such as the hiring process,
- collaborated with the product teams on **software architecture decisions**,
- built an [automation system][] in **Rust** and **WebAssembly** for
  non-engineers.

[automation system]: https://github.com/blendle/automaat

I have grown significantly as both an engineer, software architect and a leader
during my time at Blendle. Through passion and dedication I have expanded my
knowledge not only on a technical level, but also on a communications and
managerial level.

Throughout my journey from engineer to CTO and back to engineer, I have found
a balanced combination of passion and dedication for the craft of software
engineering combined with my natural talent and enjoyment of helping others grow
and leading teams and projects. Merging both disciplines in a balanced manner.

## Earlier Work

### Software Engineer Consultant, ASM Lithography (ASML)

From **April 2014 – October 2014**, I worked as a consultant from Kabisa ICT for
the Dutch lithography company ASML. During my stint at ASML I worked with Ruby,
Perl and Windows Batch scripts. I also worked on an enterprise scale Jenkins
CI/CD setup and took on the role as a scrum master within our division.

### Software Engineer, Kabisa ICT

From **September 2012 – January 2015**, I worked on multiple projects, both
in-house and on-site at customers. My main language of choice was Ruby, combined
with the Rails framework, but there were some other languages as well (including
JavaScript) and there was a not insignificant focus on infrastructure as code
using Unix, Chef, Puppet and later Ansible and Docker.

### Freelance Software Engineer

From **April 2009 – September 2012**, in my early years after graduating
I worked as a freelance software engineer, doing mostly contract jobs for local
companies. I used languages such as PHP, Ruby, HTML/CSS and JavaScript to write
custom CMS systems, mailing list systems, and maintained websites for customers.

### Study: Multimedia & Software Engineering

I studied and graduated from the University of Applied Sciences ”Hogeschool
Zuyd” in The Netherlands. The study (formally called ”Communication & Multimedia
Design”) introduced me to a cross-section of disciplines that proved useful in
my future career such as software engineering, graphics & user interface design,
marketing and communications. I knew early on that my passion would lead me down
the software engineering road, but all other skills taught to me here have
helped me achieve what I have achieved so far.
